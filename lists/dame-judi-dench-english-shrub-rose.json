Beginning as striking, red-tipped buds they gradually open to reveal large informal rosettes, each with ruffled petals and a button eye. They are very resistant to rain damage and the petals drop neatly. There is a light, but lovely, fresh Tea fragrance. A vigorous grower, it produces strong, arching stems which, over time, form an attractive mound of blooms. Named after one of Britain's most beloved stars of stage and screen. David Austin, 2017."}
