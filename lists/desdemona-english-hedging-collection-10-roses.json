The blooms are chalice-shaped; the incurved petals creating an arresting interplay of light and shadow. Over time, the blooms open a little wider, just enough to catch a glimpse of the pretty stamens within. They flower over an exceptionally long season, maintain their shape during wet weather. A lovely Old Rose and almond blossom fragrance with hints of cucumber and lemon zest. \r\n\r\nPlus 4 x Mycorrhizal Fungi 3oz pouch."}
